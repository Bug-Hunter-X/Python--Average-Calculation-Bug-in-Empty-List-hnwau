This repository showcases a common error in Python when calculating the average of a numerical list. The primary issue arises when an empty list is passed to the averaging function. This README will elaborate on the problem and provide a straightforward solution.   The original code, found in 'average_bug.py', lacks robust error handling for the case of an empty input list. This leads to a 'ZeroDivisionError' exception when the function attempts to divide by zero.   The corrected code, presented in 'average_solution.py', addresses this by explicitly checking for an empty list and returning 0 to avoid the exception. This enhanced version ensures the function handles both empty and non-empty lists gracefully.  The solution exemplifies a simple yet crucial aspect of defensive programming, where edge cases are anticipated and accommodated to prevent unexpected program behavior.
